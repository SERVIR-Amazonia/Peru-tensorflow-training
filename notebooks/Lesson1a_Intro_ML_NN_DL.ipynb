Machine learning narrows this scope by focusing on the ability of machines to learn and improve from experiences without being explicitly programmed.\n",

        "1. **Automation**: Minimizes the need for manual interpretation or analysis of data.\n",
        "1. **Reduction of human error**: By learning from data, machines can avoid biases or errors introduced by humans.\n",

These deep neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain—albeit far from matching its ability—in order to 'learn' from large amounts of data. In a neural network, additional layers can learn more complex relationships to make predictions with higher accuracy compared to simpler models. In an image recognition task, for instance, lower layers might identify edges, while deeper layers could identify the concepts relevant to a human, such as digits or letters or faces. The deepest layers of a network once trained can infer highly abstract concepts, such as what differentiates a farm from a forest in satellite imagery.\n",

        "The transformer is a powerful deep learning model that was first introduced for sequence processing in text ,speech, and natural language in the 2017 paper [\"Attention is all you Need\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). It motivates the Transformer and self attention for a few reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "* For modeling with sequences, like pixel time series, or lengths of text, RNNs are hard to parallelize and difficult to train.\n",
        "* CNN based methods increase the number of computations needed to relate two input positions. So it is harder for a CNN based sequence model to capture long term memory effects\n",
        "* In contrast, multi-head self attention and the transformer architecture are easier to train, easy to parallelize, and input values can be related to each other in constant time no matter how far apart they are.\n",
        "\n",
        "Attention, the primary mechanism in a transformer, is a generalization of a multi-layer perceptron. With attention, any input pixel in an image can attend to any number of other pixel in an image. This is in contrast to a CNN, where pixels in one convolutional layer only attend to a neighborhood of pixels, and is also different from a multi-layer perceptron, where the connections (or \"attention\") between nodes in a layer are fixed and cannot change.\n",
        "\n",
        "Attention is a very flexible mechanism that scales well. Since it makes so few assumptions between elements in a sequence, it can eventually learn efficient and powerful representations between inputs given enough data. But since it makes fewer assumptions than other mechanisms, it takes longer to train. We'll revisit transformers and attention later on in the lesson to discuss how recent architectures ([the Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929)) address computation and data constraints, in computer vision and specifically in remote sensing.\n"
