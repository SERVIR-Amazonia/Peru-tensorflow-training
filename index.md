# Peru SERVIR TensorFlow Training Earth Science Applications in Amazonia
This training will bring technicians and geospatial specialists leaders from the Amazon region to learn about ML, DL and AI fields to join Earth Sciences. The training is expected to grow participantsâ€™ technical capacities to employ ML, DL, and AI solutions, equipping participants to train future trainers, and strategically position SERVIR to seed innovation by providing cutting edge science and solutions in SERVIR regions. By the end of this training series, participants will:
1. Have a firm understanding on the use of ML, DL, and AI as well as the basics of TensorFlow, especially within the Google Earth Engine framework;
2. Learn about Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Classification, Segmentation, Object Detection, Regression and Time Series Analysis;
3. Generate knowledge in workflows about remote sensing and ML, DL, and AI in order to be able to publish in academic journals;

The lesson content for each workshop can be found in the tabs on the lefthand side panel. Additionally, you can find information about all the workshop partners under the **Partners** tab, supplementary learning material under the **Resources** tab, and photos from the workshops (and a place to upload your own photos) under the **Photos** tab.
